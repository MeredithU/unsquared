==UnSquared: the Event app.

Be there, don't be square.

==About
UnSquared was created as an alternative to commonly used event websites. It is intended to be used not only as a source for event info but as a central location for event social integration.
Featuring in-app functionality for sharing over social networks as well as an event-specific searchable Instagram hashtag view, this site is meant to be visited not only as an event approaches but also once it is over.
This application was created using Ruby on Rails, Javascript and JQuery. Intended users of this app are event hosts, event guests, and voyeurs who want to see all the pictures the next day!

The user can:

*Create, View, Edit, and Delete an Event.
*Sign in and out with Twitter or Facebook
*Upload pictures to an event
*Tweet about an event from the event page
*RSVP to an event from the event page
*Search Instagram hashtags from the event page

This application was created by Emma Hardman and Meredith Underell as a final project for the CodeFellows Ruby Bootcamp in Seattle, WA.
